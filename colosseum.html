    <p>The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an ancient landmark in the heart of Rome, Italy, and
        one of the most iconic symbols of Roman architecture and engineering. Built between 70-80 AD under the reign of
        the Flavian emperors, it remains a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most visited tourist attractions in
        the world.</p>
    <h3>Architectural Marvel</h3>
    <p>The Colosseum is an elliptical amphitheater made primarily of concrete and sand. It stands as a testament to the
        advanced engineering and construction techniques of ancient Rome. Measuring 189 meters long, 156 meters wide,
        and towering 50 meters high, it was the largest amphitheater ever built in the Roman Empire and could
        accommodate up to 50,000 to 80,000 spectators.</p>
    <h3>Purpose and Use</h3>
    <p>The Colosseum was used for a variety of public spectacles, including gladiatorial combats, animal hunts,
        executions, reenactments of famous battles, and even mock naval battles during its early years. These events
        were designed to entertain the public and demonstrate the might and grandeur of the Roman Empire.</p>
