    <p>The Castel Sant'Angelo, also known as the Mausoleum of Hadrian, is a towering cylindrical fortress located on the
        banks of the Tiber River in Rome, Italy. Originally built as a mausoleum for the Roman Emperor Hadrian and his
        family between 123–139 AD, it has evolved over centuries into one of Rome's most historic and multifaceted
        landmarks.</p>
    <h3>Historical Evolution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mausoleum of Hadrian: Initially constructed as a grand tomb for Emperor Hadrian, his family, and subsequent
            emperors, it marked the Roman tradition of monumental burial sites.</li>
        <li>Military Fortress: In the 5th century, it was repurposed as a military stronghold to defend Rome from
            invading forces. Its strategic position near Vatican City made it a key defensive structure.</li>
        <li>Papal Residence and Refuge: During the medieval period, Castel Sant'Angelo became a refuge for popes during
            times of danger. A secret passage, the Passetto di Borgo, connects it to the Vatican, allowing safe escape
            during sieges.</li>
        <li>Prison and Museum: Over the centuries, it also served as a prison and is now a museum showcasing its rich
            history.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Architectural Features</h3>
    <p>The structure is a striking combination of Roman, medieval, and Renaissance architecture, reflecting its varied
        uses over time. Its cylindrical design is crowned by a large statue of the Archangel Michael, commemorating the
        legend of the angel’s apparition that ended a plague in Rome in 590 AD. <br> Today, visitors can explore its
        well-preserved interiors, including ancient Roman burial chambers, papal apartments, and military
        fortifications. The castle also offers stunning panoramic views of Rome and the Vatican from its terrace, making
        it a favorite spot for photography and history enthusiasts.

        The Castel Sant'Angelo is not only a testament to Rome's layered history but also a symbol of its enduring
        strength and beauty.</p>
