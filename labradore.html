  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>Labradors, officially known as Labrador Retrievers, are one of the most popular and beloved dog breeds in the
    world. They are medium to large-sized dogs known for their friendly nature, intelligence, and versatility, making
    them excellent family pets, working dogs, and companions. Originating from Newfoundland, Canada, Labradors have a
    rich history as loyal helpers and are now celebrated for their adaptability to a wide variety of roles.</p>
  <h3>Physical Characters</h3>
  <p>Labradors are athletic and sturdy dogs, characterized by their balanced build and distinctive features: <br>

    <br> <b> Size:</b> Labradors are medium to large-sized dogs. Male Labradors typically stand 22.5 to 24.5 inches tall
    and weigh between 65 to 80 pounds, while females are slightly smaller, standing 21.5 to 23.5 inches tall and
    weighing 55 to 70 pounds.
  </p>
  <p><b>Coat:</b> Labradors have a short, dense, and water-resistant double coat that helps them stay warm in colder
    conditions. Their coat is easy to maintain and sheds moderately.</p>
  <p>The Labrador Retriever originated from the island of Newfoundland in Canada in the 1700s. They were initially bred
    to assist fishermen by retrieving fish and pulling in nets from the cold waters of the North Atlantic. These dogs
    were originally known as St. Johnâ€™s Dogs or Lesser Newfoundland Dogs. <br>

    In the 1800s, Labradors were brought to England, where they were refined into the breed we recognize today. Their
    retrieving skills and exceptional temperament made them popular as gundogs for hunting, particularly for retrieving
    waterfowl.
