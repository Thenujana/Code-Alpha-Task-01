    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular and beloved dog breeds in the world, known for its friendly
        nature, intelligence, and versatility. Originally bred as a hunting dog in Scotland during the 19th century, the
        Golden Retriever was developed by crossing various breeds, including the now-extinct Tweed Water Spaniel and the
        Yellow Retriever, to create a dog with exceptional retrieving abilities in both water and on land. Today, Golden
        Retrievers are cherished not only for their hunting skills but also for their loving temperament, making them
        ideal family pets, service dogs, and working dogs. <br> <br> Golden Retrievers are active and energetic dogs
        that require regular exercise to stay happy and healthy. They love outdoor activities such as walking, running,
        hiking, and swimming, as well as games like fetch, which cater to their retrieving instincts. Without adequate
        physical and mental stimulation, they can become bored or develop destructive behaviors. Along with their high
        energy levels, Golden Retrievers are known for their strong appetite and can be prone to obesity if overfed, so
        a balanced diet and portion control are essential.</p>

    <p>While Golden Retrievers are generally healthy dogs, they can be prone to certain health issues such as hip and
        elbow dysplasia, certain heart conditions, and cancer. Regular vet check-ups, a nutritious diet, and a healthy
        lifestyle can help minimize these risks. With proper care, Golden Retrievers typically live 10â€“12 years, and
        their unwavering loyalty, affectionate nature, and playful spirit make them cherished members of any household.
        Their adaptability, intelligence, and loving temperament have earned them a permanent place in the hearts of dog
        lovers around the globe.</p>
