    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>The Australian Shepherd, often called an Aussie, is an intelligent, energetic, and versatile herding dog known
        for its boundless energy and strong work ethic. Despite its name, the breed was developed in the United States,
        not Australia. Originally bred to herd livestock, Australian Shepherds are now valued as both skilled working
        dogs and affectionate family pets. Their intelligence, loyalty, and trainability have made them a popular choice
        for active individuals and families who can match their high energy levels. <br><br>Australian Shepherds are
        medium-sized dogs with a sturdy and athletic build. They typically weigh 40–65 pounds and stand 18–23 inches
        tall at the shoulder. One of their most striking features is their coat, which is medium-length,
        weather-resistant, and comes in a variety of beautiful color patterns, including blue merle, red merle, black,
        and red, often with white and tan markings. Their bright, expressive eyes can be brown, blue, amber, or even a
        mix of colors, which adds to their unique and captivating appearance. Some Australian Shepherds are born with
        naturally short tails, though others may have long tails that are often docked in some regions. <br>Australian
        Shepherds are best suited for active and committed owners who can provide them with the mental and physical
        stimulation they need to thrive. Their combination of intelligence, energy, and loyalty makes them a joy to own
        for those who can match their enthusiasm for life. Whether as a herding dog, a sports competitor, or a loving
        family pet, the Australian Shepherd is a hardworking and affectionate companion that brings joy and energy into
        any household.</p>
