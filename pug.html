    <p>Pugs have a long and storied history, dating back over 2,000 years to ancient China. They were originally bred as
        companion dogs for Chinese royalty and were highly valued for their flat faces and wrinkled features, which were
        thought to resemble good fortune.

        nobility and royal families. The breed became a symbol of wealth and status, and they were particularly adored
