    <p>The Statue of Liberty, officially named "Liberty Enlightening the World", is an iconic symbol of freedom,
        democracy, and hope. Located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, it stands as one of the most recognizable
        landmarks in the United States and a globally admired cultural icon.</p>
    <h3>Historical background</h3> <br>
    <p>The statue was a gift from France to the United States, commemorating the enduring friendship between the two
        nations and celebrating the centennial of American independence in 1876. It was designed by French sculptor
        Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, with the internal iron framework engineered by Gustave Eiffel, who later designed
        the Eiffel Tower. The statue was completed in France in 1884, disassembled, and shipped to New York, where it
        was reassembled and officially dedicated on October 28, 1886.
        <br>
        The Statue of Liberty is a powerful symbol of freedom, democracy, and hope for millions of immigrants who
        arrived in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For many, it was the first sight of
        America as they entered through nearby Ellis Island, the nation’s busiest immigration station at the time. It
        has since come to represent the ideals of equality, opportunity, and human rights.
