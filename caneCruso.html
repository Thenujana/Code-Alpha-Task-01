    <p>The Cane Corso, also known as the Italian Mastiff, is a large and powerful dog breed known for its loyalty,
        intelligence, and protective nature. Originating in Italy, the Cane Corso has a history as a working dog, used
        for guarding property, livestock, and even serving as a companion in hunting. Their name "Cane Corso" translates
        to "guardian dog" in Latin, which perfectly describes their natural instincts to protect their family and home.
        Today, Cane Corsos are cherished as both guardians and loving family companions. <br><br>Cane Corsos are
        muscular and athletic, with a commanding presence that exudes strength and confidence. Males typically stand
        24–28 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh between 90–120 pounds, while females are slightly smaller. They have
        a short, dense, and weather-resistant coat that is easy to maintain, and their coat colors can include black,
        gray, fawn, red, and brindle patterns. Their expressive eyes, broad head, and square-shaped muzzle give them an
        intelligent</p>
