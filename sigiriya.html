    <p>Sigiriya, often referred to as the "Lion Rock," is an ancient rock fortress and UNESCO World Heritage Site
        located in the Matale District of Sri Lanka. Rising nearly 200 meters (660 feet) above the surrounding plains,
        this majestic rock formation is one of the country’s most iconic landmarks and a testament to Sri Lanka's rich
        history and cultural heritage.</p>
    <h3>Historical background</h3>
    <p>Sigiriya dates back to the 5th century CE and was built during the reign of King Kashyapa (477–495 CE). After
        seizing the throne from his father through a controversial coup, Kashyapa sought to protect himself from
        potential enemies, including his half-brother, the rightful heir to the throne. He chose Sigiriya as the site
        for his new capital, transforming the massive rock into an impenetrable fortress and an opulent royal palace.
        The site was strategically designed to include complex water gardens, moats, and walls to provide both
        protection and luxury.

        After Kashyapa's death in battle, Sigiriya was abandoned as a royal residence and later became a Buddhist
        monastery until it was eventually deserted. Today, it stands as a symbol of ancient engineering, art, and
        architecture.</p>
    <p>Sigiriya is renowned for its unique combination of urban planning, architecture, and artistry, including: <br>

        The Lion’s Gate: The name "Sigiriya" is derived from "Sihagiri," meaning "Lion Rock." The Lion's Gate, located
        halfway up the rock, features massive carved lion paws that once formed part of a larger structure resembling a
        lion. Visitors would enter through the lion’s mouth, symbolizing strength and power.

    </p>
    <p>The Frescoes: The western face of the rock is adorned with beautiful frescoes painted directly onto the rock
        surface. These paintings, which are over 1,500 years old, depict celestial maidens, often referred to as the
        "Sigiriya Damsels." Their vivid colors and intricate details reflect the artistic excellence of the era.</p>
