    <p>The Eiffel Tower, or "La Tour Eiffel" in French, is one of the most iconic and recognizable structures in the
        world. Located in Paris, France, on the Champ de Mars near the banks of the Seine River, it has become a global
        symbol of art, engineering, and French culture. The tower was designed by the French engineer Gustave Eiffel and
        his company as the centerpiece for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World's Fair), which was held to celebrate
        the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution and to showcase France's technological and industrial
        achievements.</p> <br><br>

    <p>Construction of the Eiffel Tower began in January 1887 and was completed in March 1889, taking just over two
        years. Made entirely of wrought iron, the tower stands at an impressive height of 330 meters (1,083 feet) with
        its antenna, making it the tallest structure in the world at the time of its completion. It held this title
        until the construction of the Chrysler Building in New York City in 1930. The tower's design features a lattice
        structure that provides remarkable stability, allowing it to withstand strong winds and even sway slightly
        during storms, which is a testament to its innovative engineering.Construction of the Eiffel Tower began in
