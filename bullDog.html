    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>These dogs are one of themost common dogs that acts as a pet world wide . This type is very friendly and
        intelligent. <br>
        Bulldogs, often referred to as English Bulldogs, are a popular and distinctive breed known for their muscular
        build, wrinkled face, and endearing personality. Originally bred in England for bull-baiting—a now-outlawed
        sport—they have since evolved into gentle, affectionate, and loyal companions. With their unique appearance and
        easygoing nature, Bulldogs are a favorite among families, singles, and seniors alike.
        <br> <br>
        Bulldogs have a stocky, medium-sized build with a wide chest and sturdy frame. They typically weigh between
        40–50 pounds and stand 14–15 inches tall at the shoulder. Their most recognizable feature is their wrinkled
        face, which is paired with a short, pushed-in nose and a distinctive underbite. Bulldogs have a short, smooth
        coat that comes in a variety of colors, including white, fawn, brindle, red, or a mix of these. Their droopy
        lips, round dark eyes, and small, floppy ears give them a comical yet lovable expression that is hard to resist.
        <br><br>While Bulldogs have a charming personality, they do come with specific health concerns. Due to their
        brachycephalic (flat-faced) anatomy, they are prone to breathing issues, snoring, and overheating. Other common
        health issues include hip dysplasia, skin infections (particularly in their facial wrinkles), and joint
        problems. Regular vet check-ups, a balanced diet, and proper grooming—such as cleaning their wrinkles to prevent
        infections—are essential to their well-being. Bulldogs typically have a lifespan of 8–10 years.
